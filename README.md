**1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing**

   Perform data exploration to uncover patterns and insights.
    Handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
    Prepare the data through normalization and transformation for optimal model performance.

**2. Modeling and Evaluation**

  Implement and evaluate various binary classification models, including:
        - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        - Random Forest
        - Decision Tree
        - Other commonly used classifiers
   -  Address class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
   -  Combine models using a Soft Voting Classifier to improve overall prediction accuracy and F1 scroe.

**Key Features**

  **1.Data Preprocessing:** Focused on transforming raw data into a clean and analyzable format.
  **2.Model Comparisons:** Evaluate multiple models to identify the most effective one for predicting churn.
  **3.Class Imbalance Handling:** Incorporate techniques to ensure balanced model performance across all classes.
  **4.Soft Voting Classifier:** Combine predictions from multiple classifiers for better performance.
